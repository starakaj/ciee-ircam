## Setup
- Make sure everyone's got a MIDI controller
- Review a bit of yesterday's material
- Talk about Max's Quickrecord function

## In-class assignment FOUR HANDS
- You've got all three hours to build, rehearse and record a piece for four hands
- The piece must use a single midi controller
- It should use only sinusoidal oscillators and noise generators
- It can use a mouse/touchpad if you want, could control vibrato, pitch bend, tremolo, up to you
- You might want to start by experimenting individually, then bringing your work together into a single patch
- You might also come up with a plan, then decide to split the work
- Please submit your patch and a recording of your performance by the end of the class.
