## Setup
- Make sure everyone has a MIDI controller

## 2 - 2:30
- Watch a "cool stuff in Max" video, just to settle in
- Quick review of the stuff we talked about yesterday.
- Mouse mapping. Use the mousestate object along with a scale object to make a wave machine
- Difference between white, pink and brown noise (also rand~ noise for fun)
- Different kinds of noise on each axis
- If there's time, add a key / keyup pair to make it playable

## 2:30 - 3
- MIDI. How to get MIDI in using the [midiin] object
- midiparse to split it to bits
- midiformat to return it to midi
- Difference between control change and note events
- Send + receive + prepend + route
- Play a note using the MIDI controller

## 3 - 3:05 BREAK

## 3:05 - 3:30
- Simple stuff that you can build using a MIDI controller
- Turn something on and off by pressing a note
- Send a range of notes to a particular place
- Scale a value like frequency according to an exponent other than 1 (and why you'd want to do this)

## 3:30 - 4
- Make the timbral adjuster together (one dial can drive multiple things at once)

# 4 - 4:05 BREAK

# Remaining Time: LAB
- Simple: Classic monophonic synthesizer. Knobs to control attack, decay, sustain and release.
- Harder: Same, but add a control for pitch bend and (if you know how) tremolo
- Impossible: Add knobs to mix together different timbres. Try for example sliding between a harmonic and an inharmonic timbre with a single knob.
