# Polyphony with poly~

## Setup
- Quick review of groove~, just to remind people how it works.

## 10 - 10:30
- Simple synth that uses thispoly~ to play a whole bunch of notes additively

## 10:30 - 11
- Synth that uses midinote in order to manage voice allocation using an adsr~ object

## 11 - 11:05 BREAK

## 11:05 - 11:30
- Polyphonic synth that mixes together a bunch of sawtooth waves with random delays for some phase cancellation goodness

# 11:30 - 12:00
- Polyphonic synth that plays random samples all layered on top of each other, with a given tuning (unfortunately use the bag object)

## 12 - 12:05 BREAK

## 12:05 LAB
- Demonstrate the boids example. Use kink~ to add some variety to the waveform
- Come up with another cool system to create interesting sounds using boids
- Consider the sampling objects that we've used already (play~ would be something very interesting to try here)
- Come up with something else entirely
- Record the output, submit the patch along with the sound
